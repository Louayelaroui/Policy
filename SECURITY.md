# Security Policy
1. User Authentication:
Our application requires users to authenticate themselves before gaining access. The login credentials are securely stored and encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

2. Data Protection:
Sensitive data such as prices, quantity, tax, transport, and surface areas are handled and stored securely. Data at rest is encrypted and data in transit is sent over secure, encrypted connections to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Access Controls:
Our application implements strict access controls to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access and perform actions within the app.

4. Updates and Patches:
We regularly update our application to patch any security vulnerabilities that may arise. Users are encouraged to keep their applications up to date.

5. User Privacy:
We value user privacy. All user data collected by our application is used solely for the purpose of providing and enhancing our services. We do not share or sell user data to third parties.

6. Security Audits:
Our application undergoes periodic security audits to identify and rectify any security loopholes. We are committed to providing a secure environment for our users.

7. Incident Response:
In the event of a security incident, we have a response team ready to address and mitigate the issue. Users will be informed about the incident and the steps we're taking to resolve it.

8. User Education:
We encourage our users to follow good security practices such as using strong, unique passwords and not sharing their credentials with others. Information about such practices is shared with the users through the application and/or via emails.

Remember, this is a simple, general security policy description. Depending on the complexity and requirements of your application, you may need to provide more detailed and specific policies. Be sure to consult with a cybersecurity expert or legal advisor to ensure your policy is comprehensive and compliant with any relevant regulations.
